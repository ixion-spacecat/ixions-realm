This is my submission to the

32-Bit Cafe 2025 Valentine's Day Event
{%- endlink %}.
The prompt was to make a digital Valentie's day gift dedicated to myself.
This was surprisingly difficult, but it was a wonderful exercise in
practicing self-love this February 14th.

Dear Ixion,

I know this past year has been hard for you. You've been going through a period of change and self-discovery. I just want to take a moment to remind you that you are loved.

Here are a 14 things I love about you.

1. You are strong. You shoulder your responsibilities day after day, and I admire your strength to do so.

2. You are resilient. You've been through so much, and you survived. When the future feels uncertain, remember that you've survived things like this before, and you can survive this.

3. You are empathetic. I've seen you cry at movies (even the happy ones). You can feel for others so deeply. I love that about you; just don't forget to feel for yourself sometimes too. <3

4. You are understanding. You genuinely want to see the best in others. You know what it's like to be misunderstood, so you give other's the grace you would want in return. Remember to protect yourself from those who would take advantage of your good nature. Compassion is not weakness; it is strength.

5. You are caring. When you care for someone, you put their wants and needs above your own. You want to please them, protect them, and make them feel at home. Everyone deserves that, and so do you. <3

6. You are loyal. When you find a good person, you stick with them and support them. Don't beat yourself up for the ones that have drifted away; it's okay; it's a part of life.

7. You are curious. When something catches your attention, you dive down the rabbit hole and learn everything you can about it. The world needs curious people like you.

8. You are creative. I love seeing that spark ignite within you. Let it shine and illuminate the world around you in the way that only you can.

9. You are unique. You see the world differently, in your own strange and beautiful way. So go ahead, be weird. I love your weird. Your friends will love it too. <3

10. You are tenacious. When you know something's important, you don't give up. If it's important, you'll find a way.

11. You are fun. When you smile, you let others in on the silly strange world you hold within your heart. You're fun to be around. Let other's see it more.

12. You are passionate. When you focus on something (or someone) you make it feel like they're the whole world to you, and that's truly amazing. I love seeing you get passionate, and others will love it too. <3

13. You are sensual. Your senses can be overwhelming and even painful at times, but they can also give you pleasure and connect you to the world. Good food, a sweet smell, a gentle touch--you have such capacity for joy and I appreciate the intensity with which you can experience the world.

14. You are human. A single point of experience among billions, yet uniquely your own. That alone is reason enough to be loved. <3

You are worthy of love.

No matter what this valenties day brings, remember that. Give your love to others because they deserve to know how much you care. But don't forget to receive it as well. You are loved and you deserve to be loved.

With Love <3,<br/>-- Ixion
