Not a whole lot happened in my February, yet I seem to never have enough time to write...

## RSS Feed

This one is kind of cheating. I worked on the RSS feed early on in February but I got distracted and set it aside. It wasn't until today (march 3rd) that I actually finished the [feeds page](/feeds/) and put it up on the website. But I'm still counting it as a success for February!

I also refactored my CSS stylesheets, reorganized my templates, and made a lot of other behind-the-scenes improvements. Details are in the [changelog](/changelog/).

## Valentines Day

Valentines day was a bit complicated for me: specifically the week leading up to it.

I was stressing about the 32-bit cafe valentines day event. The prompt was to give myself a valentine. Sounds simple enough, but when it comes down to it it's actually really hard to say nice things about yourself (at least it is for me). I agonized over this for several days before finally breaking down and forcing myself to do it. I started by reading old valentines cards that I've kept over the years. Then I actually wrote my valentine's day card for my partner. It's easier to say nice things about her than it is to talk about myself. Once I was in the spirit of writing kind words, I went to my whiteboard and filled it with things I like about myself. That became my blog post [14 things I love about you](/blog/2025/14-things-i-love-about-you/). It was a tough exercise but I think it turned out pretty well. ^.^

Around valentines day, my friend who I've been dating told me she needed to take a break. I understand it's for personal reasons and I see why it makes sense for her at this time, but it still stings a bit. Polyamory is hard. We're still friends; these things happen; it will just take some time to adjust.

On the other hand my actual valentines day was really good! I took the day off work and spent the day with my partner Ellie. We went to a nice restaurant we like, exchanged cards, and shared warm feelings that lasted the entire evening. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I'm not sure how to tie a nice bow around all that, but I appreciate the love I have in my life.

## Self Care

I'm still using the finch app! I hit my 30 day streak! üê¶

## Plans for March

Maybe look at houses? Our lease is up soon. I'm shamefully unaware of our finances right now, but I'm hoping we have enough to buy something ü§û

My anniversary with Ellie is coming up soon! ‚ù§Ô∏è Time to make reservations.

I'm experimenting with the idea of creating a short text adventure on my website. No promises, but maybe I'll post that up in March.
