You lay down on the soft blanket and close your eyes just for a minute. The sound of the rain is so relaxing. You drift off to sleep...

You're awakened by a sunbeam on your face. You're not sure how long you slept. The rain has stopped and the sun is showing through the clouds.


As you stand up to leave, you notice a wooden door in the back wall of the cave. Was it there before?
