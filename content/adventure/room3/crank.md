The crank is in pretty bad shape, but you manage to turn it and the key begins to lower.

Suddenly there's a loud "SNAP!" and the crank breaks off in your hand. The chain slips off the pulley and the key falls into the barrel.

Looking into the barrel, you see the key is underwater still attached to the chain.
