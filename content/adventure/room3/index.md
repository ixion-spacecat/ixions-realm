Barrel Room

You are standing in a square stone room with a large wooden barrel in the center. A key with the inscription "determination" is suspended from a chain above the barrel. The key is too high up for you to reach. The chain wraps around a pulley in the ceiling that is connected to a rusty old crank on the right side of the room.
