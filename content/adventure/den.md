You close your eyes just for a few minutes. The sound of the rain is so relaxing. You drift off to sleep...

---

You awaken to a soft thumping sound. Opening your eyes you see the white rabbit from before is looking at you from across the room. It seems curious. You try not to make any movements that might scare it away.

Looking around the room, you notice that the fire has died down. You wonder how long you were asleep. You get up to examine your clothes--they seem to be dry.

---

The rabbit hops across the room. It exits through a small open doorway in the wall across from you. Was that doorway there before?

---

The doorway is about two feet tall, far too small for you to fit through. Beyond the doorway is a winding corridor lit with a dim blue light. Above the doorway is a small plaque that reads "ATTACHMENT: Only the light of heart may pass."

---

You gently put down your car keys. You feel a sensation of lightness as you begin to shrink! You're about a foot shorter than you were before.

---

You gently put down your wallet. You feel even lighter and you begin to shrink even smaller. Now you're shorter than the side-table.

---

You gently put down your phone. You shrink until you're the size of the doorway. You've never felt lighter!

By now you realize there's some magic stuff going on here so you decide to just go with it.
