You're walking alone on a path in the woods. The leaves above you rustle gently in the wind as they glow with the autumn sun. It's a cloudy day with a cool breeze, but for a moment the sun beams down through a hole in the sky to wrap your shoulders in a warm embrace. You close your eyes, exhale, and reflect on the events of the day.

It almost seems unreal: today you met up with a long-lost relative. Just a week ago you didn't even know that they existed, and today you were having lunch with them in their kitchen.

---

You were surprised to find that they welcomed you into their home. It was a bit cluttered, but cozy, and the walls were decorated with old photos of family members you'd never met. You recognized one photo of your great grandmother, but the rest of the photos were of a family you had never known. They themselves were about your age and had been living on their own for quite some time. They had a pleasant demeanor and spoke with a slightly different accent from your own. The two of you shared stories and bonded over similar life experiences, to the point where you could see the family resemblance, but then they'd chime in with an expression you'd never heard of before and the illusion was broken. It's almost as if you were talking to another version of yourself that grew up in an alternate universe.

"Why the sudden interest in genealogy?" they asked you. To be honest you're not sure what drove your interest in learning about your family tree. Maybe it was boredom that fueled your sleepless nights. Maybe it was a need for human connection that made you pick up the phone. Maybe it was a need to get away from daily life that drove you to make the four hour car trip to a town you'd never heard of. But either way, you're here now, and all of that ceased to matter the moment you knocked on their door.

At the end of your visit, you thanked them for the meal and shared a hug before saying your goodbyes.

"You know, there's an old hiking trail that runs through the woods behind my house" they said with a smile. "If you have time you otta go for a walk before you head back: clear your head."

It sounded like a good idea at the time. You weren't in any hurry to get back to being an adult. This trip had been a nice vacation from your responsibilities back home.

That was an hour ago.

---

A dozen wet pinpricks wake you from your thoughts. It has started to rain.

You think about turning back, but it quickly turns into a downpour. You're getting soaked. You need to get out of the rain.

---

You see a white rabbit hop across the path and up a hill to your right. You see a cave in the side of the hill, and there's a glowing orange light suspended in the air near the entrance. The rabbit bounds up the hill and disappears inside the cave.
