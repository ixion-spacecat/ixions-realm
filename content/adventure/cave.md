You follow the rabbit up the hill to the entrance of the cave. You can now see that the orange light is coming from a lantern that hangs from a sign that says "Travelers Welcome". The cave itself forms a stone room that's tall enough for you to stand in comfortably. It appears to be dry and safe, so you step inside to get out of the rain.

The rain is really pouring down now. Your clothes are wet but you managed to get out of it before getting too soaked. You check the time. It's still a few hours until sunset. You could try to wait out the rain before heading back.

---

Now that you're out of the rain, you realize you're starting to feel hungry. The last time you ate was several hours ago back at the house. It was a bit of an odd conversation.

---

They asked you "What's your favorite drink?"

You said diet coke. They were amazed and said it's their favorite too and they have a whole case of it in the fridge! You bonded over having the same favorite drink.

Then they asked you "What's your favorite food?"

You told them you've had a craving for a carrot raisin muffin all day. You half expected them to materialize one out of a cupboard, but unfortunately they were fresh out. They ended up making you a sandwich instead. It was a good lunch and you thanked them for it, but you couldn't help but feel a twinge of disappointment.

---

By now, your eyes have adjusted and you can see deeper into the cave. What you thought was a solid back wall actually contains a wood-framed glass window looking out into a larger chamber that glows with a warm flickering light. To the left of the window, an open doorway leads down a curving set of stairs towards the light, and unexpectedly, the smell of carrot raisin muffin?

---

You carefully make your way down the narrow stairwell. It curves slightly to the right as you descend and the sound of rain becomes more muffled behind you.

At the bottom, the stairs open into a circular room that forms a cozy well-appointed den. A modest fireplace built into the stone back wall casts a warm light that flickers across the wood paneled walls and the glass window high above. At the center of the room, an ornate circular rug hosts a cushy red chair with a small round footstool and a side table. On the walls, there's a bookshelf stocked with reading materials, and a small kitchen area complete with a stove top, pantry, and cupboards. You find yourself amazed that someone had built this all into a cave, but then again the sign outside did read "Travelers Welcome".

The enticing smell draws you to the kitchen area. There's a small sign on the countertop that says "Help yourself". In the kitchen you find a single can of diet coke, and surprisingly, a fresh carrot raisin muffin.

---

You're so hungry, you eat the carrot raisin muffin while standing near the countertop.

You take the diet coke over to the red chair and decide to warm yourself up by the fire. You sit down and find that the red chair is every bit as soft and cushy as it looks. You feel the warmth from the fire drying off your clothes. You're not sure who made this restful room, but you're sure glad they did. You take a sip of your drink and feel the stress leaving your body. All your responsibilities and everything from your life back home feels so distant. They'll all be there when you get back. You can afford to kick up your feet and rest for a while longer.
