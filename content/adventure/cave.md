You approach the cave and find that it's about the size of a small bedroom. It appears to be safe and dry. You duck inside to escape the rain.

On the ground, a soft picnic blanket has been laid out over the dirt. It looks clean. You sit down for a moment to catch your breath.

Outside, the rain is pouring down. You feel lucky you found this cave when you did, otherwise you'd be soaked. 

You sit quietly and watch the sheets of rain moving across the treetops in the valley below. The smell of the rain fills the air, and some other familiar scent you can't quite place. You feel tired. Maybe you could close your eyes for just a few minutes...
