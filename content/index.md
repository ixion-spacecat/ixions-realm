# Welcome!

I'm **Ixion**, and this is my little corner of the internet!

I'm on a personal mission to rediscover the creative spark that burned inside me as a kid. Somewhere along the way, I forgot it existed. Now I'm ready to get it back!

I try to make this site accessible for desktop, mobile, and screen readers. I'm still new at this so if you see any ways I can improve accessibility please [contact](/contact/) me.

This site uses javascript for the theme switcher and a few widgets and games. I use {%link "https://ixions-realm.goatcounter.com/help/privacy" %}GoatCounter{%endlink%} to estimate site visits.
