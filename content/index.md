# Welcome!

I'm **Ixion**, and this is my little corner of the internet!

I'm on a personal mission to rediscover the creative spark that burned inside me as a kid. Somewhere along the way, I forgot it existed. Now I'm ready to get it back!

## Yay Blog! ðŸ“–

I have a [blog](/blog/) now!!!

My first [post](/blog/2025/2024-in-summary/) is a summary of 2024 and my goals for the year to come.

## Halloween Mini-Game ðŸŽƒ

I made a run-and-jump mini-game for last year's 32-bit cafe Halloween event, complete with original pixel art!
You can play it on my [Halloween page](/events/2024/halloween/)

## What else is here?

- The portrait of my sona you see on this page (I drew it myself ^.^)
- An [art page](/art/) with some game designs from when I was a child.
- A list of my [special interests](/interests/) (there's a lot of them ðŸ¤¯)
- An unsatisfactory explanation of [why I am the way that I am](/about/)

## What's to come?

- An RSS feed
- More art (and possibly music)
- More games
- Shrines
- More cool things TBD
