# Welcome!

I'm **Ixion**, and this is my little corner of the internet!

I'm on a personal mission to rediscover the creative spark that burned inside me as a kid. Somewhere along the way, I forgot it existed. Now I'm ready to get it back!

## Yay Blog!

I have a [blog](/posts/) now and I actually posted something! 😁

## 🎃 Halloween Event

Last year I participated in the 32-bit cafe Halloween event! I went a little overboard and created a mini game with original pixel-art!

You can play the mini-game on my [Halloween page](/events/2024/halloween/)

## What else is here?

- The portrait of my sona you see on this page (I drew it myself ^.^)
- An [art page](/art/) with some game designs from when I was a child.
- A list of my [special interests](/interests/) (there's a lot of them 🤯)
- An unsatisfactory explanation of [why I am the way that I am](/about/)

## What's to come?

- More art
- My music
- Shrines
- Special projects (to be announced)
