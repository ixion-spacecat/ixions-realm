# Feeds

I decided to split this into 3 separate feeds. You can choose based on how you organize them in your feed reader.

### Everything

- [feed.xml](/feeds/feed.xml) -- blog + announcements (you can filter by "category" in your feed reader)

### Separate Feeds

- [blog.xml](/feeds/blog.xml) -- only blog posts
- [announcements.xml](/feeds/announcements.xml) -- new features or website content (every few weeks)

## Problems?

If you find any issues please [let me know](/contact/). I'm still new to setting up Atom feeds and I'd appreciate any feedback to help improve accessibility.
