# Feeds

[blog.xml](/feeds/blog.xml) -- only blog posts

[announcements.xml](/feeds/announcements.xml) -- when I add stuff to the site (every few weeks)

[feed.xml](/feeds/feed.xml) -- blog + announcements (you can filter by "category" in your feed reader)

## Problems?

If you find any issues please [let me know](/contact/). I'm still new to setting up Atom feeds and I'd appreciate any feedback to help improve accessibility.
