## <span aria-hidden="true">🏛️</span> Museum of Childhood Game Designs

When I was a kid, I dreamed of being a game developer. Now that I'm an adult, I'm working as a programmer in a different industry.

This section is here to celebrate the creativity of my childhood self and some of the imaginative game designs he came up with.

Here you can read the reviews I've written for the games I designed when I was 10. Unfortunately this is the only way to experience these classic games due to the fact that they never existed.

Classic Sonic the Hedgehog, but more awesome! 😄
