It's taken over a month, but I've completely rebuilt the website from the ground up!

- Brand new static site built on {%link "https://www.11ty.dev/" %}eleventy{%endlink%}
- Responsive 2-column layout
- Embedded image galleries that work on desktop and mobile
- Cool new theme inspired by Sega Genesis
- 'Game Reviews' of some of my [childhood game designs](/art/)
- Expanded list of my [special interests](/interests/)
- Details [about me](/about/) and a new portrait of my sona Ixion
