This year I participated in the 32-bit cafe Halloween event! I went a little overboard and created a mini game with original pixel-art!

<div class="inline-image-row">
  <img src="/images/share/ghost.gif" alt="">
  <img src="/images/share/pumpkin1.png" alt="">
  <img src="/images/share/zombie.gif" alt="">
  <img src="/images/share/skeleton.gif" alt="">
</div>

You can play the mini-game on my [Halloween page](/events/2024/halloween/)
