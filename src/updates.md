# Updates

## 22 Sept 2024
"Ixion's Realm" is born!

It's taken over a month, but I've completely rebuilt the website from the ground up.
- Brand new static site built on {%link "https://www.11ty.dev/" %}11ty{%endlink%}
- Responsive 2-column layout
- Embedded image galleries that work on desktop and mobile
- Cool new theme inspired by Sega Genesis
- 'Game Reviews' of some of my [childhood game designs](/art/)
- Expanded list of my [special interests](/interests/)
- Details [about me](/about/) and a new portrait of my sona Ixion

## Old Designs

{% gallery "history" %}
{% galleryImage "/img/history-self-in-progress.png", "Placeholder page called 'self-in-progress'", "This was the first incarnation of the webiste. It only contained a list of things I like, and a webneko named Lucy." %}
{% endgallery %}
