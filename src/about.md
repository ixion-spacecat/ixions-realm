## Ixion (Fursona)

Ixion is a dark-blue humanoid catacorn who mysteriously appeared on earth one night in a flash of lightning, having no memory of who he was or where he came from. He finds earth to be a strange place where people don't mean what they say. He's tried his best to fit in with the locals, but has always felt out of place among them.

Recently he's found a way back to the realm from which he came. More and more of his memories are returning, and he is slowly rediscovering the magical entity that he always was.

## Ixion (IRL)

Sadly, in real life I'm not a dapper cat-boy and I can't shoot lightning out of a magic horn in my head. I'm an autistic human, living in a neurotypical society that demands that I work to survive. Sometimes I feel like my fursona--living in a harsh unfamiliar world that was not made for us--and all I can do is cope and get through the day. But now, he inspires me to own my weirdness and start doing things for me. ðŸ’œ

By day I'm a programmer. At night, I do this... or game development, or whatever special special interest takes a hold of me for a few months at a time. I have no idea what I'm going to be doing a year from now. Hopefully this website will either document my progress towards something fun, or my slow descent into madness as my reality dissolves around me. ðŸ« 

I don't want to give the wrong impression. I'm doing pretty well all things considered. I have a good job, financial stability, and a loving partner. I may not be a cat-boy IRL but I am a cat dad to our 2 fur babies and they mean the world to me.

I'm sure there's a lot more but I'll save the rest for my therapist (or future blog posts ðŸ˜Š).
