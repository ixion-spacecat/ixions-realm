## Ixion (Fursona)

Ixion is a dark-blue humanoid catacorn who mysteriously appeared on earth one night in a flash of lightning, having no memory of who he was or where he came from. He finds earth to be a strange place where people don't mean what they say. He's tried his best to fit in with the locals, but has always felt out of place among them.

Recently he's found a way back to the realm from which he came. More and more of his memories are returning, and he is slowly rediscovering the magical entity that he always was.

## Ixion (IRL)

Sadly, in real life I'm not a magical catacorn. I'm an autistic human, living in a neurotypical society that demands that I work within the system to survive. Sometimes I feel like my fursona: living in a harsh unfamiliar world that was not made for us.

But now, he inspires me.

Ixion has a head-start on rediscovering who he is, and I intend to follow.
