# Welcome! <img src="/img/C2QgSBY.gif" alt="">

I'm **Ixion**, and this is my little corner of the internet!

I'm on a personal mission to rediscover the creative spark that burned inside me as a kid. Somewhere along the way, I forgot it existed. Now I'm ready to get it back!

## What's here now?
- The portrait of my sona you see on this page (I drew it myself ^.^)
- A list of my [special interests](/interests/) (there's a lot of them ðŸ¤¯)
- An unsatisfactory explanation of [why I am the way that I am](/about/) <img src="/img/autistic-pride.png" alt="autistic pride badge" height=20px>

## What's to come?
- More art
- My music
- Shrines
- A blog... about stuff!
- Special projects (to be announced)
