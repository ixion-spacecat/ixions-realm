This is my review of "Sonic: Reimagined" - a mash-up of classic sonic games that lives only in the head of my 10-year old self.

There are several original characters as well as new Zones added to the classic sonic games.

## Drawing Sonic the Hedgehog

When I was around 10 years old, I got Sonic 2 for the Sega Genesis. The game was a bit difficult, but I had already cut my teeth on the original Sonic The Hedgehog and I was ready for the challenge. The graphics were absolutely gorgeous and I wanted nothing more than to learn how to re-create what I saw on screen. So what did I do? I paused the game and tried to draw it!

What follows is a list of hand-drawn screenshots from Sonic 2.

A few interesting notes:
- In the title screen, the word Hedgehog is misspelled, however we can see from the eraser mark that I tried to correct the spelling by adding a D. A valiant effort!
- I started off freehanding the characters, but quickly moved on to using stencils to have more control over my shapes. This gives the characters a very geometric look that I haven't seen in any other Sonic Game.
- The title for Chemical Plant doesn't fit on the page. I did a much better job with the title of Metropolis Zone later on.
