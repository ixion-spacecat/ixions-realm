# üê∏ Terminal Frog

This is my review of "Terminal Frog", a 2D action platformer game from my imagination as a 10-year old kid. The game only exists as some sketches on wide-ruled notebook paper, but we can fill in the blanks by comparing it to similar games of the time.

## Inspired by Vectorman

Terminal frog is a 2D platformer game inspired by "Vectorman" (Sega Genesys 1995). Unfortunately I couldn't find a detailed drawing of the titular "Terminal Frog" but I assume they would have been a little green frog dude made of 3d-rendered balls like Vectorman.

## Game Play

### Controls


{% gallery "controls-and-options" %}
{% galleryImage "/img/art-terminal-frog-controls.jpg", "Controls" %}
{% endgallery %}

The controls give us a window into the kinds of things Terminal Frog can do. Their main actions are jump, ram (attack), snatch (presumably with a long sticky tongue), shield, pick up, and throw. They can also rear back for a super jump. The movement controls indicate that there may be some top-view levels in addition to the normal side-scrolling action.

Compared to Vectorman, Terminal Frog doesn't seem to have any long range attacks (with the possible exception of the "snatch" attack). This means the game would rely on landing precise melee strikes on enemies more like a classic Sonic game.

Note: I don't know of any game controller that has a "D" button, so it's entirely possible this game was designed to be played on a futuristic game console that had not yet been invented. ü§ì

### Views and Power Ups

{% gallery "controls-and-options" %}
{% galleryImage "/img/art-terminal-frog-options.jpg", "Views and Power Ups" %}
{% endgallery %}

I think these views were intended to be a part of the options menu.
- Jump Range Indicator: an accessability option?
- Foreground: disable the background (why?)
- Thermal Vision: see heat signatures behind walls
- Radar Vision: detect invisible platforms

Could there be secret passages or hidden platforms that are only detectable with thermal or radar? Who can say? But it would be pretty cool to see thermal vision in a 16-bit era game.

Lastly we have the 4 power ups.
- Jump Booster
- Ram Booster
- Energy Booster
- Life Booster

Jump booster and ram booster most likely just increase your jump distance and attack power respectively. It's unclear what the energy booster does. Maybe Terminal Frog needs this energy to power the thermal vision or radar? The life booster is probably just an extra life.

## Levels

{% gallery "levels" %}
{% galleryImage "/img/art-terminal-frog-levels.jpg", "Level storyboards", "We see here an unfinished chart with storyboards for the beginning, middle, and end of each level. There are spaces for up to 7 levels plus an intro sequence, but only the first two rows have complete storyboards." %}
{% endgallery %}

Level 0 seems to be some sort of intro sequence. First we see something falling off an assembly line. Then there seems to be a giant lizard stealing a house?! Finally it's revealed that there's a mastermind robot controlling the giant lizard or something! ü§ñ

Level 1 is named "Sunshine Valley" (spelled incorrectly). It seems Terminal frog lives in a lake because in the first scene we see them jumping out of the water. The second image gives us some cool floating platforms in a helical shape, indicating there's some sort of 3D effect. The level ends with some massive metal girders shooting into the grass. I assume this means the evil robots are attacking terminal frog in their home, which spurs them into action!

The next 2 levels are listed as "Skyscraper" and "Aircraft" but unfortunately there are no storyboards for these.

## Enemies

Next we get a list of enemies that can be seen in each of the first 5 levels.

{% gallery "enemies" %}

{% galleryImage "/img/art-terminal-frog-enemies-1.jpg", "Level 1 Enemies", "Level 1 'Sunshine Valley' is the first time we see the walking robot enemy which is referred to as a drone (spelled 'Droan'). We can see from the listed stats that it's transportation is 'legs'. There's also a tiny mouse named 'Nips' that can bite you. Lastly, there's a stationary trap called a 'Bush Saw' that is described as an 'invertant buzz saw' (Sounds scary! üò¨). For some reason there's no boss in level 1." %}

{% galleryImage "/img/art-terminal-frog-enemies-2.jpg", "Level 2 Enemies", "Level 2 'Skyscraper' gives us 2 new enemies. First there's a wall spider, which presumably climbs walls. It shoots venom from it's 'gun form' so I assume that it is some kind of transformer. There's also an enemy called a 'Bomber Beetle' that is essentially a small helicopter that shoots missiles and bombs. This level sees the return of the drone but this time without the wind-up key. The boss of the skyscraper is the 'Boss Spider' which has a venom gun and infinite missiles. It takes 10 hits to kill." %}

{% galleryImage "/img/art-terminal-frog-enemies-3.jpg", "Level 3 Enemies", "Level 3 'Aircraft' might be some kind of aircraft carrier. There is only 1 new enemy, the 'Foul Falcon' (pun intentional?) which flies with medium/fast speed and fires 2 bombs and 2 lasers. The drone has gotten an upgrade and now has a jetpack. The drone's speed is listed as 'Medium, Fast, or M/S', which I can only assume means that it is fast while flying but still medium slow while walking. The Bomber Beetle is the same as in level 2." %}

{% galleryImage "/img/art-terminal-frog-enemies-4.jpg", "Level 4 Enemies", "Level 4 is unnamed, but we can infer from the enemies that it takes place underwater. The drone now has flippers and travels with a medium speed. There's a new 'Torpedo Shark' that has '2 torpedoes, infinite shark torpedoes (which are apparently different from regular torpedoes), and a harpoon gun. Unsurprisingly, the shark's transportation is 'fins'. There's also a puffer fish themed enemy named 'Puffs' who is concealing a laser and has dangerous 'Expandable spikes'. Finally we see that the boss of this level is a robotic kraken named 'Octo-Major'. It has 8 arms with tentacles and a laser. It takes 5 hits on the nose and 10 hits in the eye to kill it." %}

{% galleryImage "/img/art-terminal-frog-enemies-5.jpg", "Level 5 Enemies", "Level 5 is unnamed. I assume it takes place at least partially in the water because we see the torpedo shark has returned. The drone is now walking again and seems to have reverted back to its form from level 2. There's a new 2-legged enemy called a 'Spere Cannon' that attacks with a 'top-firing cannon'. Maybe this enemy walks in the shallow water and fires spears up to hit the player on a platform above. The final boss of this level is also unnamed, but it appears to be a hovering airplane with a multi-phase design that requires the wings to be hit first before the other targets become available." %}

{% endgallery %}

Note: This last boss is reminiscent of the VTOL Boss from the first level of Vectorman

## Conclusion

I think Terminal Frog would have been a fun game. Even though we don't have a picture of the frog, I can imagine this little green dude ramming their way through armies of cartoonish robotic enemies. It's a shame we don't know more about the "snatch" move listed in the controls, as I can see that adding a new layer of gameplay similar to Yoshi's tongue-grab from Super Mario World.

My main criticism is that the game may suffer from some balance issues with the enemies. There doesn't seem to be a clear escalation of difficulty between levels, and in one case we see enemies reverting back to an easier version seen in a previous level. Some enemies have limited ammunition, which would make them defenseless after they've run out of shots; however this might actually be a good thing because terminal frog doesn't appear to have any ranged attacks (with the possible exception of the "snatch" move).

We only see 3 bosses, but the ones we do see actually look pretty cool. The spider and the octopus would be quite menacing to see full-screen, and battling them as a tiny frog would be a harrowing experience.

In conclusion, I think the game design is good, although incomplete. I would have liked to see some actual level designs that show how terminal frog gets to use some of the cool abilities that are hinted at in the options menu.

## Rating

Terminal Frog: 7/10

Balance is a bit sticky, but the gameplay is ribbiting! üê∏
