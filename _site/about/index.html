<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>call me: ixion (he/them)</p>
<p>age: millennial</p>
<p>location: united states (utc-8)</p>
<p>neurotype: autistic + ADHD</p>
<p>identities: atheist, demi-pansexual, polyamorous</p>
<p>relationship: partnered</p>
<h2>Ixion (Fursona)</h2>
<p>Ixion is a blue humanoid catacorn who mysteriously appeared on earth one night in a flash of lightning, having no memory of who he was or where he came from. He finds earth to be a strange place where people don't mean what they say. He's tried his best to fit in with the locals, but has always felt out of place among them.</p>
<p>Recently he's found a way back to the realm from which he came. More and more of his memories are returning, and he is slowly rediscovering the magical entity that he always was.</p>
<h2>Ixion (IRL)</h2>
<p>Sadly, in real life I'm not a dapper cat-boy and I can't shoot lightning out of a magic horn in my head. I'm an autistic human, living in a neurotypical society that demands that I work to survive. Sometimes I feel like my fursona--living in a harsh unfamiliar world that was not made for me--and all I can do is cope and get through the day. But now, he inspires me to own my weirdness and start doing things for me. ðŸ’œ</p>
<p>By day I'm a programmer. At night, I do this... or game development, or whatever special special interest takes a hold of me for a few months at a time. I have no idea what I'm going to be doing a year from now. Hopefully this website will either document my progress towards something fun, or my slow descent into madness as my reality dissolves around me. ðŸ« </p>
<p>I don't want to give the wrong impression. I'm doing pretty well all things considered. I have a good job, financial stability, and a loving partner. I may not be a cat-boy IRL but I am a cat dad to our two fur babies and they mean the world to me.</p>
<p>I'm sure there's a lot more but I'll save the rest for my therapist (or future blog posts ðŸ˜Š).</p>
