          <h1>🐸 Terminal Frog</h1>
<p>This is my review of &quot;Terminal Frog&quot;, a 2D action platformer game from my imagination as a 10-year old kid. The game only exists as some sketches on wide-ruled notebook paper, but we can fill in the blanks by comparing it to similar games of the time.</p>
<img src="/images/art-terminal-frog-cube.jpg" alt="Childish drawing of a frog in a cube" width=350px/>
<h2>Inspired by Vectorman</h2>
<p>Terminal frog is a 2D platformer game inspired by &quot;Vectorman&quot; (Sega Genesis 1995). Unfortunately I couldn't find a detailed drawing of the titular &quot;Terminal Frog&quot; but I assume they would have been a little green frog dude made of 3d-rendered balls like Vectorman.</p>

<h2>Game Play</h2>
<p>We don't have any drawings of levels, but we can get an idea of how the game would play by looking at the controls and options.</p>
<p><div class="gallery">          <div class="gallery-item">      <div class="gallery-item-image-container">            <a href="/images/art-terminal-frog-controls.jpg"      class="glightbox gallery-image"      data-gallery="gallery-controls-and-options"      data-title="Controls"      data-description=""    >      <img src="/images/art-terminal-frog-controls.jpg" alt="Controls" class="gallery-item-image"/>    </a>        </div>      <div class="gallery-item-text-container">        <p class="gallery-item-title">Controls</p>              </div>    </div>      <div class="gallery-item">      <div class="gallery-item-image-container">            <a href="/images/art-terminal-frog-options.jpg"      class="glightbox gallery-image"      data-gallery="gallery-controls-and-options"      data-title="Views and Power Ups"      data-description=""    >      <img src="/images/art-terminal-frog-options.jpg" alt="Views and Power Ups" class="gallery-item-image"/>    </a>        </div>      <div class="gallery-item-text-container">        <p class="gallery-item-title">Views and Power Ups</p>              </div>    </div>      </div></p>
<p>It appears the gameplay consists mostly of jumping and ramming into enemies. There's also a 'snatch' move which I assume is a long sticky tongue like Yoshi from Super Mario World. There's a dedicated button to rear back and do a super jump, which must be useful somehow. And at the risk of including too many actions, there are additional buttons to deploy a shield, pick up and throw objects.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I don't know of any game controller that has a &quot;D&quot; button, so it's entirely possible this game was designed to be played on a futuristic game console that had not yet been invented. 🤓</p>
<p>There's a list of views in the options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jump Range Indicator: an accessability option?</li>
<li>Foreground: disable the background (why?)</li>
<li>Thermal Vision: see heat signatures behind walls</li>
<li>Radar Vision: detect invisible platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>Could there be secret passages or hidden platforms that are only detectable with thermal or radar? Who can say? But it would be pretty cool to see thermal vision in a 16-bit era game.</p>
<p>Lastly we have 4 power ups, which seem to just boost the power of existing abilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jump Booster</li>
<li>Ram Booster</li>
<li>Energy Booster</li>
<li>Life Booster</li>
</ul>
<h2>Levels</h2>
<p>The game has a total of 7 levels, but we only have drawings for a few of them.</p>
<p>The chart below shows storyboards for the beginning of the game. It looks like a giant lizard is wreaking havoc on the city 🏫🦖, but in a surprising twist, the lizard is being mind controlled by a giant robot or something! 🤖 Then Terminal Frog jumps out of a pond and springs into action!</p>
<p>After that we see a list of enemy designs for the first 5 levels.</p>

<p>I have to give my 10 year old self credit for consistency here. Every enemy has the same stat block of &quot;Name, Danger, Transportation, and Speed&quot;. This gives a way to compare the speed and armaments of every enemy and shows a trend towards increasing firepower in the later levels. Interestingly, several enemies appear to have a limited supply of ammunition which makes me wonder what happens when they run out.</p>
<p>The use of a consistent stat block has the side effect that some of the stats are filled in with ridiculously obvious things like the drone having &quot;transportation: legs&quot; or the mouse having &quot;danger: bite&quot;.</p>
<p>Most of the levels have a unique theme, and the enemies change to reflect that. The drone (spelled &quot;droan&quot;) appears in every level with slight modifications to adapt to the environment. For example the drone in 'Aircraft' has a jetpack and it's speed is listed as 'Medium, Fast, or M/S', which I can only assume means that it is fast while flying but still medium slow while walking. The drone in the water level has fins so that it can swim.</p>
<p>The bosses of the game are all robotic and have multiple weapons. The boss spider has a venom gun and missiles, while the octopus 'Octo-Major' has 8 tentacles and a laser. Several bosses appear to be multi-stage, with the hovering airplane explicitly requiring hits on each wing, then 10 on the body, and 3 on the guy (I guess there's a guy inside).</p>
<p>This last boss may have been inspired by the VTOL Boss from the first level of Vectorman.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think Terminal Frog would have been a fun game. Even though we don't have a picture of the frog, I can imagine this little green dude ramming their way through armies of cartoonish robotic enemies. It's a shame we don't know more about the &quot;snatch&quot; move listed in the controls, as I can see that adding a new layer of gameplay similar to Yoshi's tongue-grab from Super Mario World.</p>
<p>My main criticism is that the game may suffer from some balance issues with the enemies. There doesn't seem to be a clear escalation of difficulty between levels, and in one case we see enemies reverting back to an easier version seen in a previous level. Some enemies have limited ammunition, which would make them defenseless after they've run out of shots; however this might actually be a good thing because terminal frog doesn't appear to have any ranged attacks (with the possible exception of the &quot;snatch&quot; move).</p>
<p>We only see 3 bosses, but the ones we do see actually look pretty cool. The spider and the octopus would be quite menacing to see full-screen, and battling them as a tiny frog would be a harrowing experience.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I think the game design is good, although incomplete. I would have liked to see some actual level designs that show how terminal frog gets to use some of the cool abilities that are hinted at in the options menu.</p>
<h2>Rating</h2>
<p>Terminal Frog: 7/10</p>
<p>Balance is a bit sticky, but the gameplay is ribbiting! 🐸</p>
